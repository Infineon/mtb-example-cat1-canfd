# CAN FD

Controller area network flexible data-rate (CAN FD) is a communication protocol typically used for broadcasting sensor data and control information on 2-wire interconnections between nodes. This example demonstrates how to use CAN FD in Infineon's PSoC&trade; 6 MCU, CYW20829 and CYW89829 device.

In this example, the CAN FD Node-1 sends a CAN FD frame to CAN FD-Node-2 on pressing the user button and vice versa. Both the CAN FD nodes log the received data over the UART terminal. Each time a CAN FD frame is received, the user LED toggles.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration for CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W. See the kit user guide and schematic to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The AIROC&trade; CYW89829 Bluetooth&reg; kit (CYW989829M2EVB-01) requires rework on the board to work with CAN. CAN RX/TX use P3.2 and P3.3 which was used for UART and connecting to J12 in default. To use UART, UART can map to P1.2(ARD_D5_SWDIO) and P1.3(ARD_D4_SWDCLK), Need remove jump on J12 5&6 and J12 7&8, connect J6.4(ARD_D5_SWDIO) to J12.5 and J6.3(ARD_D4_SWDCLK) to J12.7. Since P1.2 and P1.3 worked for UART, SWD for debug is not possible.

**Note:** The AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; kit (CYW920829M2EVK-02) ships with KitProg3 version 2.21 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3 with latest version 2.40. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

**Note:** CY8CKIT-062S4 requires rework on the board to work with CAN. Replace **R124** with **R125** to connect P5[1] of the MCU to J4[4]. See [PSoC&trade; 62S4 Pioneer Kit schematic](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-062s4/#!?fileId=8ac78c8c7d710014017d7153484d2081) for details.

This code example requires minimum two kits listed in the
[Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) section. The first kit runs this example as is; the second kit should be programmed with the `USE_CANFD_NODE` macro as "CANFD_NODE_2" in the *main.c* file.

In addition, each kit from [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target) requires a CY8CKIT-026 (CAN and LIN Shield) kit, which acts as the physical layer for each node.

**Note**: Here, pins 1 and 2 of J20 of CY8CKIT-026 are shorted using a jumper. See Section 3.6.4, **Power Selection Jumper (J20)** of the [CY8CKIT-026 CAN and LIN Shield kit guide](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/cy8ckit-026/#!?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0efb313a110d) for more details.

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.
Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox&trade; Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and the command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The "project-creator-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-cat1-canfd](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-cat1-canfd)" application with the desired name "MyCANFD" configured for the *CY8CPROTO*-*062S3*-*4343W* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062S3-4343W --app-id mtb-example-cat1-canfd --user-app-name MyCANFD --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can invoke the Library Manager GUI tool from the terminal using `make library-manager` command or use the Library Manager CLI tool "library-manager-cli" to change the BSP.

The "library-manager-cli" tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--add-bsp-name` | Name of the BSP that should be added to the application | Required
`--set-active-bsp` | Name of the BSP that should be as active BSP for the application | Required
`--add-bsp-version`| Specify the version of the BSP that should be added to the application if you do not wish to use the latest from manifest | Optional
`--add-bsp-location`| Specify the location of the BSP (local/shared) if you prefer to add the BSP in a shared path | Optional

<br>

The following example adds the CY8CKIT-062S4 BSP to the already created application and makes it the active BSP for the app:

   ```
   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyCANFD" --add-bsp-name CY8CKIT-062S4 --add-bsp-version "latest-v4.X" --add-bsp-location "local"

   library-manager-cli --project "C:/mtb_projects/MyCANFD" --set-active-bsp APP_CY8CKIT-062S4
   ```

</details>


## Operation

1. Connect the CAN and ground pins of the development kit using the instructions in the [Hardware setup](#hardware-setup) section.

2. Connect the CANFD-NODE-1 development kit to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector to program the device.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Connect the CAN FD-NODE-2 kit to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector. Open the *main.c* file and set the `USE_CANFD_NODE` macro to `CANFD_NODE_2`, and follow **Step 3**.

5. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

6. Press **SW2** from NODE-1, for transmission of frame from NODE-1 to NODE-2 and vice-versa.

7. Observe the results in the terminal window. You can see the print-logs from both nodes by opening another instance of the terminal. Figure 2 shows the print logs from both nodes.

    **Figure 2. Sample output with CAN FD data transmission and reception**

    ![](images/canfd_output.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only for CYW989829M2EVB-01)** SWD debug is not possible if enable UART with P1.2/P1.3 since they overlap with SWD pins.

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** (applicable here only for PSoC6) On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice â€“ once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

Controller Area Network Flexible Data Rate (CAN FD) is a data communication protocol used for broadcasting sensor data and control information on 2-wire interconnections between different parts of the electronic instrumentation and control system. Using CAN FD, Electronic Control Units (ECUs) can dynamically switch between different data rates and longer or shorter messages.

In this code example, the CAN FD block is configured with custom configurations because it is not configured to work with default BSP configurations.

This design consists of a CAN FD configuration as nodes and a user button. On a button press from one node, nodes send the CAN frame to the other and vice versa; both the CAN FD nodes log the received data over the UART serial terminal. The user LED toggles each time a CAN FD frame is received.


### CAN FD frame format

ID   - CAN FD identifier
DLC  - Data length code
Data - Actual data bytes

ID  | DLC | Data
------|------------|------
0x22 | 0x08 | 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x04 0x05 0x06 0x07 0x08
